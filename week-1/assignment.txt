With this message, I'd also like to give detailed requirements for the assignment:
1. You will need to create a simple landing page (use the pdf file attached as a reference)
2. We will give you freedom on what the content of the page will be (not necessarily have to use the text provided in the pdf) 
3. The page will need to have these elements:
- Image as header
- Short article section (give the proper title and content)
- Create a list consisting of links
- Create 3 social media "buttons" (with a proper link to said social media)

We will grade your work by these criterias:
1. Requirements fullfillment - 60% (make sure you make all the elements stated above)
2. Appearance - 20%
3. Creativity - 20% (go wild with your creativity by adding other elements, as long as it still fullfill the criterias and looks neat)
